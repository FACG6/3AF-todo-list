This app helps people to organize their tasks in the life daily.

## Our working strategy:
In our team we work in Pairs, we specify each pair tasks they have to accomplish. 
First pair: created the repository, CSS, test(step 1&2) and logic(step 1&2) readme files.
Second pair: finished test, finished logic and Dom files.
Finall we reviewed all of the code, and all functions as one team.

Finally: It was a great experience. We enjoyed teamwork.

    • We learned how to divide the tasks between team members.
    • We learned how make TDD tests.
    • We learned how write pure functions
    • We learned how use DOM manipulation.
